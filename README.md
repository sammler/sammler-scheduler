# sammler-scheduler

> Scheduler for sammler.

## Purpose

<!-- Purpose -->

_sammler-scheduler_ publishes messages to RabbitMQ based on scheduled events (jobs).

It is also the responsibility of _sammler-scheduler_ to store the initial state of jobs (using _sammler-jobs-service_).

## Work in progress

Right now, _sammler-scheduler_ just contains a very basic (and more or less hardcoded) solution, to get messages into the system.

## Environment variables

* `SAMMLER_RABBITMQ_URI`
* `SAMMLER_JOBS_SERVICE_URI`
* `SAMMLER_LOG_SERVICE_URI`
