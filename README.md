# sammler-scheduler

> Scheduler for sammler.

## Purpose

<!-- Purpose -->

_sammler-scheduler_ publishes messages to RabbitMQ based on scheduled events (jobs).

It is also the responsibility of _sammler-scheduler_ to store the initial state of jobs (using _sammler-jobs-service_).

## Work in progress

Right now, _sammler-scheduler_ just contains a very basic (and more or less hardcoded) solution, to get messages into the system.

## Install

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:sammler/sammler-scheduler-service.git
```

Install yarn globally:

```sh
$ npm install -g yarn
```

## Configuration

The following environment variables need to be defined for running the service:

* `SAMMLER_RABBITMQ_URI`
* `SAMMLER_JOBS_SERVICE_URI`
* `SAMMLER_LOG_SERVICE_URI`

## Build & Run

Run the development environment:

```sh
$ yarn run dc-dev-up

# Just a shortcut for 
# $ docker-compose f=./docker-compose.dev.yml run --build
```
