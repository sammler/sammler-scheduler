<!-- Build & Run -->

Run the development environment:

```sh
$ yarn run dc-dev-up

# Just a shortcut for 
# $ docker-compose f=./docker-compose.dev.yml run --build
```

Hint:  
The development environment relies on some basic services defined in [sammler-base](https://github.com/sammler/sammler-base)
